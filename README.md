See through through the lens of locals!

This project aims to test the assumption that 18-21-year-old solo travelers are actively seeking unique, culturally immersive experiences that go beyond typical tourist attractions. We believe that this audience highly values personalized recommendations tailored to their specific interests, helping them discover new destinations in a more meaningful way.

Additionally, we're investigating whether these travelers would appreciate a centralized solution that consolidates relevant local information in one place, even if it's not app-based. We are exploring if platforms like a kiosk or alternative solutions can provide unique value beyond what existing mobile apps offer.

Key Objectives:
Understand Traveler Preferences: Determine whether young solo travelers are looking for personalized, culturally rich experiences.
Evaluate Alternative Platforms: Explore if a non-app-based platform (e.g., kiosks) can serve as a useful and unique tool.
Test Usability: Assess if a convenient, user-friendly solution would help young explorers discover off-the-beaten-path activities and deeply engage with local culture.
By focusing on these objectives, we aim to create a solution that caters to the specific needs and preferences of young, independent travelers, offering them a more immersive travel experience.
